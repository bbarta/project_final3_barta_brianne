# Comments
Thank you SO much for the extra time for this project. I absolutely would NOT have been able to complete this without it. I so appreciate the understanding! I've learned a lot from this project and this course but I know there's more to learn and that I'm definitely not an expert (yet!). I look forward to applying all my newfound web design knowledge to my future web design projects. Thank you Richard and Nick for all you've taught us!
