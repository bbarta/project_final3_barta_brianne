# Resources
1. [Media Queries Using a Single CSS Stylesheet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onxJ7lFPfqk)
I tried to solve my problems by watching this video, but since we had multiple widths defined for each device, I was even more confused and unsuccessful. 

2. [CSS3 Media Queries](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_mediaqueries.asp)
I tried to use this as a starting point to see if it spoke to stylesheet implementation, but mostly internal CSS was demonstrated, so I didn't have much luck here. 

3. [Introduction to Responsive Web Design](https://www.toptal.com/designers/responsive/introduction-to-responsive-web-design-pseudo-elements-media-queries)
I was hoping this article would start from the beginning and explain more of adding the media queries within the link tag inside the index.html head tag. It scratched the surface for me.

# Deductions
I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

# Comments
Thank you SO much for the extra time for this project. I absolutely would NOT have been able to complete this without it. I so appreciate the understanding! I've learned a lot from this project and this course but I know there's more to learn and that I'm definitely not an expert (yet!). I look forward to applying all I've learned in this course to my future web design projects. Thanks for all you've taught us!
